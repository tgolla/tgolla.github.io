If you're doing anything web services that return JSON here are some useful tools.

[![Image](/assets/images/posts/Json.NET-NuGet-Icon.png "Json.NET")Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/ "Json.NET"){:target="_blank"} is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET.

Need to build a .NET class for an existing JSON response?  Then try one of these class generators.

[JSON2CSharp](http://json2csharp.com/ "JSON2CSharp"){:target="_blank"} is an online tool that generates c# classes from JSON.

JSON C# Class Generator is an application that generates C# classes from a sample JSON text, so you can use strongly typed programming with JSON. Code to build the application can be found on GitHub [https://github.com/JsonCSharpClassGenerator/JsonCSharpClassGenerator/](https://github.com/JsonCSharpClassGenerator/JsonCSharpClassGenerator/){:target="_blank"}
