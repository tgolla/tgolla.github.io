![Image](/assets/images/posts/NuGet Package Explorer Logo.png "NuGet Package Explorer Logo"){: .align-left}NuGet Package Explorer (NPE) is an application that makes it easy to create and explore NuGet packages. You can load a .nupkg or .snupkg file from disk or directly from a feed such as [nuget.org](http://nuget.org "NuGet"){:target="_blank"}.  Even with the added functionality in Visual Studio to generate NuGet packaged in a build the tool is extremely useful if you are working with NuGet packages.

You can find out more about the application at its GitHub repository ([https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer "NuGet Package Explorer (NPE)"){:target="_blank"}).  Scroll down to the README.md documentation for information on installing the application.
