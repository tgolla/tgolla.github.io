[![Image](/assets/images/posts/XML-Notepad-2007-Icon.png "XML Notepad 2007"){: .align-right}](https://github.com/microsoft/XmlNotepad){:target="_blank"}Here is an old one, but a good one and you can't beat the price...FREE!  XML Notepad is exactly what you would think it is, a stand alone XML editor that goes one step farther than Visual Studio by providing a tree view and an XSL output window for XML documents that have an associated XSLT transformation file.  This is a handy tool that every programmer should have in his utility belt.  The editor can be found at the Microsoft Download Center.

8/14/2021 Update: XML Notepad 2007 is no longer available through the Microsoft Download Center.  Instead you can now find it on GitHub ([https://github.com/microsoft/XmlNotepad](https://github.com/microsoft/XmlNotepad "XML Notepad"){:target="_blank"}).
