Meet the SphereBot, an Eggbot clone. This project started many years ago when my daughter decide she was going to show chickens at the county fair. For those of you who don't live in the country, showing chickens is really a thing. While we never did get to the county fair with a chicken, and the daughter is now in college, the chickens are still around. And after building 4 chicken coops, dad has almost completed this project.

Now when I say almost completed, I mean it's only in pre-release because I have yet to complete the assembly documentation. I have been printing eggs for over 7 years and other than plans to write a simpler/user friendly version option for the non-hobbyist who has no desire to connect the SphereBot to a computer, the software is complete. 

## What's an EggBot?

The EggBot is a compact, easy to use open-source art robot that can draw on spherical or egg-shaped objects. (ref: [The Original EggBot - Simple, fun, & open source CNC art robot (egg-bot.com)](https://egg-bot.com/){:target="_blank"})

## What is a SphereBot?

The SphereBot, an Eggbot clone. Since the conception of the EggBot hobbyist have been trying to build their own version of the EggBot. Just search Thingiverse for [EggBot](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=eggbot&page=1){:target="_blank"} or [SphereBot](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=spherebot&page=1){:target="_blank"} and you will find many projects. 

## What is version 2.0?

As for the version 2.0 designation, this code is a fork of the [zaggo/SphereBot](https://github.com/zaggo/SphereBot){:target="_blank"} originally modified for the [Adafruit Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield for Arduino v2 Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438){:target="_blank"} in the [jinschoi/SphereBot](https://github.com/jinschoi/SphereBot){:target="_blank"} fork. This fork takes on a large number of changes including consistent naming conventions, an advanced G-Code parser, additional custom G-Code commands, a touchscreen control, SD card reader support and audio alerts. 

So, please check out version 2.0 [tgolla/SphereBot](https://github.com/tgolla/SphereBot){:target="_blank"}!
