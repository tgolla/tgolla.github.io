The Manager Path is written as a guide for those in the IT industry by author Camille Fournier a former developer turned CTO, that takes the reader through the different stage from being a singular contributor to managing a companies IT department and everything in between.  The book does an excellent job of describing each stage of one’s career who sees management in their future.

The book was mentioned to me by a CTO who I interviewed with for a job.  I didn’t get the job but I found the book an excellent resource when finding myself having the classic “What do you want to do when you grow up?” conversation.  Even if you have no intention of going into management, I would highly recommend you read the book in order to understand what you should and should not expect from management.  The book will help you understand the value of things like the 1 on 1 and when it’s truly time to find a new job.  Enjoy.
