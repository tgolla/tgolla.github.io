### What is a comment!

*** Needs Work ***

A comment is a programmer-written explanation or annotation written in ***natural language*** intended to make the code easier to understand for humans. 

Comments are important because they: 

- Make code easier to understand: Comments can help explain the code's purpose, functionality, or implementation details. 
- Make code maintenance easier: Proper use of comments can make it easier to maintain code and find bugs. 
- Important for functions used by others: Comments are especially important when writing functions that other people will use. 

Comments can be single-line or multi-line, and are usually written in natural language. The syntax for writing comments varies depending on the programming language. For example, in JavaScript, a single line comment is started with two slashes.
