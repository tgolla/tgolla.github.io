Recently several friends have taken notice of some of my home automation and begun to ask how can I do this. I first got into home automation many, many years ago when I build a system based off a Z8 processor. Since then I've many restarts, seen the birth and death of X10, over wired the first house I bought as part of a remodel, over wired the house I currently live in, but never really found the technology step up to the task until now. It has taken over 40 years to see hardware and software to finally mature to the point that anyone with basic DIY technical skills can automate their home.

Let start by discussing the software that makes this all possible... **Home Assistant**, a free open-source software project that allows users to automate, customize, and control their homes running on an inexpesive RasberryPi. Home Assistant has been around for over 10 years, but only in the last several years has it become a professional consumer product which is easy to install and use. The greatest thing Home Assistant brings to the table is the fact that it can talk to just about any hardware that advertizes the ability to connect to the internet and be controlled. The first time I turn Home Assistant on I was amazed as to the number of devices it discoverd to which I had no idea that they could be controlled.
